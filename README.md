## ðŸ“¸ Glimpses of the Cuewigs Website Clone

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview:

The Cuewigs website (https://www.cuewigs.com/) is admired for its captivating colour scheme, elegant typography, and sophisticated layout. Inspired by these elements, I embarked on the challenge to recreate this frontend project. I aimed to replicate its aesthetic appeal, focusing on precise positioning of elements, subtle animations, and overall visual harmony.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

- HTML: Used for structuring the site.
- CSS: Employed for design, including micro-animations and responsive layouts.
- JavaScript and Libraries:
  - GSAP: Utilized for major animations, including the first-page animation and other dynamic effects.
  - Locomotive Scroll: Implemented for smooth scrolling, enhancing user experience with seamless navigation.
  - ScrollTrigger: Integrated for creating custom scroll-based animations, such as the horizontal scroll div and various interactive elements.

## ðŸ“š Learning Experience:

This project presented exciting challenges and learning opportunities. Implementing a horizontal scroll for the first time using ScrollTrigger and GSAP was particularly enriching. Mastering ScrollTriggerâ€™s capabilities for creating intricate animations further expanded my frontend development skills. Overcoming challenges in animating the first page and perfecting element positioning added depth to my understanding of responsive design and user interface optimization.
